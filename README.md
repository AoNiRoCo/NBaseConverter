# NBaseConverter
This program has the function of converting a number to its equivalent in a positional number system on "N" base which is defined by the user, for example; If the user wants to know the representation of the number 10 ^ 10 to binary, he must enter a string equivalent to the set of symbols in binary {0,1} so that the entry in the said field will be '01', otherwise, if he wishes To know the representation in hexadecimal, you must enter the string '0123456789ABCDEF', at the same time that you must indicate the decimal number and finally omit the entry of the field referring to the “Rnary” number destined for the conversion. The program also allows the conversion of a string in Base "N" format to its equivalent in decimal, so the user must define the symbols of the base, as well as the "Rnario" number to calculate and for this case, omit the space destinated for the decimal since it will be used for the result of the said conversion.
